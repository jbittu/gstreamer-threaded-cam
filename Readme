# Multithreaded Camera Streaming System

This is a C++14-based camera streaming simulation using GStreamer, POSIX threads, and a custom logging system. Designed to mimic embedded Linux development using WSL2.

## Features
- GStreamer pipeline launch from multithreaded C++ application
- Modular logging system
- Simulated telemetry via thread control
- Designed for compatibility with embedded platforms

## Tech Stack
C++14 路 GStreamer 路 POSIX Threads 路 Linux System Programming 路 WSL2

## How to Build
```bash
g++ src/cam_stream.cpp src/logger.cpp -Iinclude -std=c++14 -pthread -o cam_stream
./cam_stream
